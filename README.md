#Purple Sky Theme 

A theme for VS Code based in purple and pink tones miked with a cold palette. 
This is a WIP. Colors and style will be changing in next version until I find the right ones. I made this theme thinking in the languages I'm using right now for my projects (Javascript, HTML, CSS and PHP) so maybe this could not look nice in others. 

If you feel curious about how this look you can clone it and try it yourself:

Change to your Visual Studio Code extensions directory:

# Windows
$ cd %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions

# Linux & macOS
$ cd ~/.vscode/extensions/

Clone repository as goodvibe:

$ git clone https://github.com/lauselfe/purple-sky-theme 

Now you can select this theme from the Theme selector in VSC
